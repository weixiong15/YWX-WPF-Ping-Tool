# YWX-WPF-Ping-Tool
Applications use the Ping class to detect whether a remote computer is reachable.Network topology can determine whether Ping can successfully contact a remote host. The presence and configuration of proxies, network address translation (NAT) equipment, or firewalls can prevent Ping from succeeding. This class provides functionality similar to the [1085461017.exe](/1085461017.exe) command line tool. The Send and SendAsync methods send an Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) echo request message to a remote computer and waits for an ICMP echo reply message from that computer.
