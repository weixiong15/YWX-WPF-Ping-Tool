## Description
Applications use the Ping class to detect whether a remote computer is reachable.Network topology can determine whether Ping can successfully contact a remote host. The presence and configuration of proxies, network address translation (NAT) equipment, or firewalls can prevent Ping from succeeding.  The Send and SendAsync methods send an Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) echo request message to a remote computer and waits for an ICMP echo reply message from that computer.
